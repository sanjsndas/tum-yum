                <p>
                    The security of your Personal Information is paramount to us. We implement a variety of technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transmitted between your browser and our servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to Personal Information is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect and retain Personal Information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery:</strong> We maintain robust backup and recovery procedures to prevent data loss.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You also play a crucial role in protecting your data by choosing a strong, unique password and keeping it confidential.
